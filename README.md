# Mini-Project
This is a project we done in our 3rd year Mini Project Review
In this present world an issue we all face together is power/energy shortage. The Traditional
energies we use such as petroleum, diesel cause pollution and is also limited. The world is
shifting towards renewable energy resources that do not cause harm to the environment and
is also available in abundance.The most popular renewable energy that we use is solar
energy. Conventional solar panels has certain disadvantages such as location, Sun availability, Installation area, Reliability etc.conventional solar cells and solar panels operate between an
minimum sunlight. Hence the conventional solar panels make up for this problem by
increasing the size and number of solar panels.This results in a large investment as solar
panels are costly. Our Product is designed in such a way that instead of the solar panels being setup in a fixed
area like conventional models , our product moves the solar panel in direction of the sunlight
so as to obtain maximum sunlight which converts it to electricity so as to increase the
effeciency.The solar tracker moves in a direction where the intensity of the sunlight is
maximum with the help of the LDR sensor.By this method we are increasing the effeciency
from the conventional method , and also very minimum electricity is used for their
movement.
